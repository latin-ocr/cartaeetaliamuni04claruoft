Ear] Raiph, who died 31st August, 1372, had married Margaret, daughter and heir of Hugh d'Audley,
Earl of Gloucester, by Margaret, a daughter and co-heir of Gilbert de Clare. Earl of Gloueester, to whom
was adjudged Newport and the Monmouthshire possessione of the de Clares, together with Tonbridge and
other English mauors.

Earl Ralph had, however, no Glamorganshire property, and certainly nothing in Cowbridge, nor had
the House of Margum any possessione. in Monmouthshire3 the de clares, indeed, had been large bene—
factors to the Abbey, and the lady might perhaps claim to share their obits. Perhaps the Abbot thought
it wise to provide for possible contingencies, and the Earl might not be unwilling to associate his name
with his wife's very distinguished ancestors.
