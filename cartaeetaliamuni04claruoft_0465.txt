This and several subsequent Charters are derived from the Carne muniments at St. Donats, and throw
much, though broken, light upon the connection of the Carnes with Nasb, and their intermarriages and
alliances with the Giles’s, Buttmss, Dalden⁷s‚ and some other families. Nash was a manor held by the
Bishops of Llandaff. [ts earliest known mesne lords were a family of J eolle or Giles, of whom Theobalda,
or Tibbet, daughter and co-heiress of John Giles, had Nash, which still remains in her descendants. Howel,
her husband, seems to have bought out his sister-in-law and to have acquired a very considerable landed
estate in the Oounty. The Charters shew how, with the connivance of the Bishop and Chapter of Llandaff,
he converted his leasehold into a freehold, an easy step towards the impoverishment of the See, upon
which snbsequent Bishops and their Chapters improved.

His grandson, a second HoweH, who married Sybil Kemeys of Newport, leit a son, Richard, who
married J oanna‚ daughter of John, and probably granddaughter of Edward Dalden of Penarth.

Wenllian evidently had an interest in the Giles property. She is usually set down as a daughter of
Tomkin Turberville of Tythegston : others make her a daughter of Evan ap Grriffith Gethyn, in which case
Lewis ap David and Robert Mathew were nephews.

Morgan ap Llewelyn ap Ievan has not been identified. He was an esquire, then indicating position,
and probably a relation ; as no doubt was William Fleming, Wenllian’s brother, Mathew ap Evan, having
married J anet Fleming of Penllyne. The conveyance is of lands only ; but as the deed is dated ‘apud le
Nasshe’‚ the donors or the recipient probably resided at the manor house.
