This, which may be regarded as a local pipe-roll for the amounts received from the Prepositus of the
chief Lord is undated, but relates probably to the earlier quarter of the lbth century. The Prepositus, in
boroughs, the mayor or chief of the municipality‚ in ordinary parishes was the chief officer of the
executive, the bedell or bailiff being the second. Both were annually elected by the freeholders.

The extract not only gives the offices, biit the names of the officers, in most cases for the current year,
but when there are arrears, of their predecessore in office. It may be noted that all the prepositi and
bailiffs here named are native Welsh. The constable is Norman, and the single farmer named, Cateley,
is no doubt English. The Welehmen are unknown even to local fame, eave two, Lewis Mathew‚a member
of a well-known family, and Meyloc or Mayloc‚ who is known as a landowner, and whose family were
lords of the manor of Lystalybont, near Gai-diff. In the lordship it does not seem the custom for the
eheriff to supply the compotus. Here that duty is performed by the prepositi, and sometimes even by the
bailiffs.

Watkyn Morton married, 9 Henry V. (1421-2‘), Gwenllian, daughter and ‹zo-heir of Robert Walsh‚ of
Llandough. He was constable of Car-diff Castle in 1424‚and at this time receiver of the lord's money. Of
prepositi, 8 are named3 of militiis, 9 ; one coroner, one collector of tallage. one far-mer of Lquythmore,
probably Leckwith moor on the Ely. The sum of the receipts is 1310 fis, chiefly derived from the sale of
stock.
