This Oharter is clearly written, upon parchment 21 ins. broad by 15 ins. deep,
occasionally worn away by frequent folding, but otherwise fairly legible.

The seal‚ now much ohipped and worn, has been a very handsome one, of
about 35} ins. diameter, out with unusual clearness and boldness, and formed of very
durable green wax. The margin is gone, but the central part is holerably perfect.
Upon ‘che one side is an armed knight riding to the proper left, and upon his
small full-bottomed shield the arms of Beauchamp and Newburgh (called Guy,
Earl of Warwiok), quarterly. The oaparisons of the horse have been emblazoned,
but are worn so nearly smooth that only ‘traces of le Despenser quartering de

Clare ean be detected.
Upon the reverse is a large broad, bhough pointed, shield. It bears quar-
terly of four grand quarters, 1. and 1v. Beauehamp‚ impaling Newburgh‚

Earl of Warwiok3 11. and 111. de Clare impaling le Despenser.
