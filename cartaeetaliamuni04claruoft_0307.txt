The seal, of red walt, is much ohipped. It bears a Knight, apparently in chain
mail, riding ‘co the proper left, having the arms of Despenser upon jupon and
shield, and upon the poitrell and eoun‘cer-caparisons of his horse. The sword
is upljfted and seoured to the armour by a light plaited chain.

The shield on the reverse seems to have been placed on the breast of an eagle‚

displayed.

 

This, the oldest extant Kenfig Clamet, and one of unusual length, is engrossed upon a §kin of stout
parchment, sixteen inches broad by twenty inches long, with a sold of three inches to carry the seal. The
character is small but clear, and the ink good. The document is perfeeffly leg-ible throughout, seve where
small holes have been worn by constanza folding and unfolding. Where this occurs the spaces are
indicated by brackets.
