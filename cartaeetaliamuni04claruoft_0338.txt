Sem-lage died seized. Further, when Richard Scurlage so died⁷ and what is the present age of Richard
Mansell? In case he should be the heir, of what tenementse etc.7 is he heir? What are they worth
annually ‘i’ By whom have they been held since the death of Scurlage ¹? In what manner, and by what
title? and whether in time past they were seized in the hands of the Lord of Gower by reason· of the
nonage of Richard Mansell.

In consequence, Sir William held an Inquisitiou on Monday, 15th June, 1 Henry IV. (1400), and made
the return⁷ whence it appears that Richard Scurlage, junior, that is son of Richard Scurlage, held under
the Lord &f Gower in Lanrithian a mill worth 405„ and lands and tenements worth GOs. annual value, of
which he died seized, on the feast of St. James the Apostle, 14 Richard Π. (25th July, 1390), when Richard
Mansess, then a minor, was his next heir.

Richard Mansell was 24 years and upwards at the Inquisition‚ and therefore born about 1376, or 49-50
Edward HL, and at Scurlage's death was about 14 years old. Thomas de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwiok
and Lord of Gower, therefore took eustody of the lands and enjoyed the profits to the quinzaine of
St. Hilary (27th J anuary), 20 Riohard IL, when Mansell came of a ge, when for some reason the wardship
was prolonged, and Thomas Mowbray‚ then Lord, recovered it in the King’s Court, and received the profits
until Michaelmas, 1399, when the King stepped in, on the ground of the minority of Thomas Mowbray‚
the heir to the Lordship.

No doubt the Inquisition took place on the petition of Richard Mansell to be admitted to his inheritance.

Scurlage Castle is not mentioned in the Inquisition. It is in Llandewi parish, not Llanrhidian‚ and may
not have been held under the lords of Gower. Had the tenure been in capite, it would have been held in
ward by the Crown⁷ and probably would have been named.

Richard Mansell held half a fee in Finelstre [Knelston] in Gower, under John Mowbray, Duke of
Norfolk, in 1432-3‚ being so named in the Inquisition on the Duke. According to the received pedigree he
was son of Sir Hugh of Oxwich, and grandson of Richard Mausell, who married Lucy, daughter and heiress
of Philip Scurlage, of Scurlage Castle. So that Scin-lage Castle may have passed to Lucy, and Llanrhidian
to an uncle or nephew, Richard, on whose death childless it would revert to Mansell, or Lucy may have
had a brother or nephew, on whose decease her grandson inherited the whole Scurlage estate. However
this may be, the Inquisition must be allowed to prove the descent, although the precise manner of it be
not upon it recorded.

Sir William Stradlyng, the seneschal- of Gower, was of St. Donats3 he is said to have gone pilgrim to
Jerusalem in 9 Henry 1V.‚ eight years later, and he married Isabel St. Barbe. As he was knighted and a.
public officer at the time of the Inquisition, his father Sir Edward was probably dead.

The family of Scurlage are reputed to descend from an ancestor who settled in Gower, where he held the
manor known as Scurlage Castle, and lands in Llangewydd and Killycum. His son, Sir Herbert Sourlage,
is said to have been employed by Rich-ard de Clare, Earl of Gloncester, against the Welsh, and to have
held the lands and built the house of Trecastle, also called Scurlage Castle, near Llantrisant‚ long after-
wards the seat of the Gibbons. Herbert was father of Sir David, he of Henry, and Henry οῖ’ Philip
Scurlage of Gower, who married Margaret οι· Mariota, daughter and heiress of Sir Richard Stackp01e‚
and was father of Lucy, who married Richard Mansell of Penrice, father of Sir Hugh.

A branch of the family, sometimes called Scurlock, settled in Ireland, and others appear in Carmarthen
and Pembroke.

The Mansells of Mai-gam were one of several families whose name shows them to be derived from the
district of Le Mans, on the river Sarthe in the upper province of Maine. They occur in six or seven
English Counties, in Ireland, and in Scotland, where two of them were Abbots of Kelso.

The Gower Mansells descend from Walter Mansell of Missenden, in Bucks, whose son, Sir Robert,
married the heiress of Langton‚and thus obtained Henllwys and Langrove, in Gower. Their son Richard,
of Missenden, married Lucy Scurhge, of Scurlage, also in Gower, and their son Hugh married Isabel
