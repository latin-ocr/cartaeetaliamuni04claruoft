who married Margaret D'Aubigny 01· Daubeny ; the-3⁷ had J can, who married William Chicheley‚ and had
issue. The Denys’ arms were ‘azure, a bend engrailed between three pards heads jessant-de-lys or.’
See ‘ Clark's Genealogies of Glamorgan‚’ p. 381.

The first Norris or Norreys on record, in Glamorgan, is a certain Robert Norris, ‘Vicecomes,’ under
Earl Robert, to whom a Gloucester Abbey chartei· is thus addressed, says Mr. Traherne, in the time of
Bishop Uchtred of Llandaff. The family held two knights' sees of william, Earl of Gloucester, and
various inquisitions shew these to have been in Penllyne. Robert was, no doubt, dead in 1166, as the
ear] then accounts for two sees held by his heir. This first Robert was possibly the builder of the square
keep, of which a fragment, with herting-bone masonry, still stands at Penllyne.

Robert Norris, or Le Nonis, probably his son, was also ‘Vicecomes’; and as such witnessed the
charters of Earl William to Margam and to Neam, cited in Francis‘s Neam, 38-39. The name also occurs
in various charters from 1257 down to 1341. (See also CLXXXIII„ DXXVIII.)

John, the next heir, gave a croft to Margam in 1188 ; and in 1270 there was a final concord between
him and Gilbert, abbot of Μαι-ἔπη, respecting lands at Bonvilston. (DXXVIII.)

Richard le Norreys, his successor, held land under the Bonvilles (CCLXI.)⁷ and witnessed charters by
Payn de Turberville to Mmgam, 1185-91; and by Gilbert de Turberville, 1207—123 and by william de
Cantlo about 12153 and by J ewan ap Gweyr, 1258.

Next was William le Norreys, who witnessed a chartei· by Raymond de Sully3 also another by P. de
CornhilL to which his brother Gilbert Norreys was witness

The Extent of 1264-ss shews that John le Norreys then held land in Penllyne‚—annual value 1:15. He
was party to a Margam deed concerning Bonvilston about 1270. (DCXLIV.)

In 1289 John, perhaps his successor, witnessed the agreement of Gilbert de Clare with Neath.
(Francis, 34.)

By the inquisition at the death of Countess J oanna in 1307 (Esc. 35 Ed. L, No. 47), Richard de Nerber
held Penssyne, probably as custos of the minor, since in the inquisition on the death of Gilbert de Clare in
1315 (8 Ed. IL, 68), John le Norreys held two sees in Penllyne and Llanvihangel, as he did in 1320 at the
Spenser Survey. He also witnessed Payn de Turbervill's chartei· to his tenants at Coyty. (H. Η. Knight
on Ll. Bren.)

In 1317 he and others were directed to raise 1,000 foot in Glamorgan (Writs, Π., 490), and in 1333 he
was upon an inquiry into the claims of the abbot of Margam to a right of wreck. In 1339 John le
Norreys witnessed Hugh le Despenser's charter to Margam, and in 1340 to Cardiffi and in 1341 to Neath.
At Hugh’s death, in 1349, John held the two fees in Penllyne and Llanvihangel. In 1358, as Sir John le
Norreys, Knt„ he witnessed charters to Oardiff and Llantrisant boroughs, and in Neath Abbey, and in
1359 to Neath borough. (Fran, p. 40.)

In 1376 the abbot of Margam granted to John Denys a lease of eighty-nine acres of land at Bonvileston
during the nonage of John, son of John Non-is, of Leche Castle. As Bonvileston had already been made
over to Margam, John was probably in ward to the abbot.

In 1453 another John le Norris, perhaps a grandson of the above, was an executor of the will of
habena, Countess of warwick, daughter of Thomas le Despenser. (Dug.‚ Bar. 1., 2473 Pat. 1 Hen. IV.)

Oollinson states that EHzabeth, daughter and heiress of John Norris of Penllyne Caene, married
William de Coker of Coker, co. Somerset. (Gon. Sem, Π., 334.) The Welsh pedigrees call her Exa, and
marry her to John Fleming. The elder of the two coheirs they call Gwenllian, and state that she had a
share of Penllyne‚ 7 Hen. VI. 3 and married, first, Tompkin Turberville‚ and second, Thomas Morgan of
Langston. It was from this match that descended the Turbervilles of Penllyne.

The ambiguity of the Nori-is genealogy is much increased by their long and successive use of the
name of John, and the absence of any inquisitions relating to them.

In 1290-1, under the head of canons and chapter of Llandaff, is an inquisition touching the mauors
taken into the king’s hands on the death of Bishop william. (I. p. M. 19 Ed. Ι.)
