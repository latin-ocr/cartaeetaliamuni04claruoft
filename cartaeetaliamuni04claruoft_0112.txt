There was, however, a family of this name, of whom Thomas, son of Will. de St. Donats, was chaplaitr
of Kenfig, and who, in 1264, gave land to Margara 3 and Baldwin de St. Donats occurs temp. Edw. ΠΙ.

The family of Van, sometimes written de Anne, and probably in one instance, Avan, appear from the
Welsh pedigree, to have resided at Marcross for 15 generations: the last being Mary Van, who proved
her father's will in 1691, described there as Mat-y Wyndham, widow. They gave off the cadet branches of*
Van, of Marshfield, Llanwern, and three others⁷ nor is the name yet extinct in Monmouthshire.

Robert de Anne was a member of the Comitatus in 1266, and witnessed charters [DCXXX11.,DXL1X.,

S.D.]‚ and 1305 [DCCCL]

The sons of John seem to have been another John and Henry.

John the IL, probably a minor, in 1317, when Margaret, widow of John de Anne, held half a fee in
Μαι-01000, valuc 210, and the other half fee, value 10 mares, was held by John de la Bere. In the Spencerv
surve)v [1320] the two halves were held by Richarcl Bassett and George Van, value 10 mares 3 possibly
George is an error for John [DCCCLXXXVI ] In 1341 John occurs as a witness [DCGCOLXXXIX]
It seems probable that it was this John who held at his death. of the heirs of Hugh le Despenser. the
Manor of Mam-oss by the seisin of one Knight's fee, value 37s. 6(1., and whose son and heir was also John.

In 1411, the name John de Anne appears as an alias of John de Stradling, junior [MCV.] His son

Henry was of Marcross in 1386, 9 Richard ΙΙ.
