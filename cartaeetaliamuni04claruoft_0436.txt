1522

As to the witnesses of the several documents. Sir Mathew or Mayo le Soor, knighted after 1340, and
Sheriff 1346, was Lord of Peterston and St. Fagans. He witnessed Cardiff Charters in 1338 and 1340.
The family came from Backwell, Co. Somerset, and had long been in Glamorgan. Sir Mathew was the
last. He married Maud, daughter and heiress of Philip Huntley, and his three daughters married Wolfe
of Wolfes Newton‚ Howell ap Οτι-1111111, and Peter de Vele, which last bad St. Fagans. Le or La Warde is
unknown in the Lordship. Sir John le Norreis was of Penlline and Llanvihangel. He witnessed, before
knighthood‚ Car-diff Charters of 1338 and 1340, and after knighthood in 1358. His ancestor, Sir Robert,
was Sheriff, under Robert Consul and william, Earl of Gloucester. Sir John left four daughters, co-
heiresses, of whom Lucy, the second, carried Penlline to the Turbervilles of that place. Sir Thomas ap
Aaron was of Brigan, and son of Aaron ap Howell vachan by Bettine‚ daughter and heiress of Sir Simon
Walsh, of Llandough, near Gowbridge, by Elizabeth Bawson, of Brigan. He was knighted after 1338, and
married J ane, daughter of Llewelyn ap Kynfrig‚ and had Sir Jenkin, whose daughter carried Brigan to the
Thomases. Pagan de Turberville was of Coyty Castle, and head of a family who, though ‘Advenae‚' often
married with, and always sided with, the Welsh. Pagan married Gwenllian, daughter of Sir Richard
Talbot. On the failure of his male heirs, his four daughters inherited, and Katherine, who married Sir
Roget Berkerolles, had Coyty. Llewelyn vachan, or the little, may be of Senghenydd‚ 311033101- to the
Lewises of Van, but is more probably the second son of Llewelyn ap Kynfrig ap Howell ap Madoc ap
Jestyn. His father was of Llantrithyd and Radyr, according to the Welsh pedigrees, and married a
daughter of Sir Ralph Mayloc. He himself was of Miscin. Madoc ap David is lost.

Llantrithyd, or as it is sometimes written Llanirid, a manor rated at half a Knight's fee, is said to have
been given by Fitz Hamon to Madoc, a son of J estyn, lord of Ruthyn, whose descendant Margaret married
John Gamage, of Coity, and carried into that family the Gamage lands in Miscin. Llewellyn Ychan, a
younger brother of J evan (Evan) had a considerable estate in Llantrithyd, but not the manor, his grand-
son, Evan ap David, is supposed to have built Llantrithyd Place in the reign of Henry VI, 3 large and
handsome house of which the ruins remain. Evan's granddaughter Jenet, married Thomas Bassett of
Beaupre⁷ their fifth son Thomas, was ancestor of the Bonvilston Bassetts ; his son John Thomas,
sheriff in 1545, added largely to the estate. The property for some reason was settled on his daughter
Elizabeth, in preference to his sons. She married Anthony Mansel, from whom descend the Aubreys, who
long inhabited ‘ the Place,' and whose descendants in the female line still own it‚and who either by 111113111-
31133 or more probably by purchase hold also the manor.

Sir Gilbert de Ellesfield is unknown 111 Glamorgan, save as High Sheriff in 1348 and 1358, but it appears
by an Inquisition of 18 Edward HL, that one of his name had lands in Berks and Wilts. Sir Richard
Turberville witnessed a Cardiff Charter in 1358 3 he may be either the father or the second son of Pagan,
probably the latter. William Fleming, who appears also in 1358, was no doubt a member of the Flimston
family, John Bassett of that of St. Hilary or Beaupre‚ and John Wallys‚ or Walsh, one of a family who
came from Somerset, and whose connection with Llandough has been mentioned. John Walsh seems to
have held Hatton, Co. Somerset, of the honour of Gloucester. Orewell was an ecclesiastic3 the others
are Welsh. Ι

Sir John 81. John, Sheriff in 1397, was of Fonmon, and acquired 1113 adjacent eastle of Penmark by
marriage with the heiress of Umfraville. Sir Lawrence Berkerolles, the last of the name, was a knight of
Somerset and Monmouthshire, but seated at East Orchard in Glamorgan. His name appears amongst the
tenants of the honour of Dunster, and he had Coyty from his mother, the coheir of Turberville. His sister
Gwenllian carried East Orchard to the Stradlings, and Sir william, the next witness was probably her
son. The rest are ecelesiastics, and unknown.

811 John Stradling, younger brother of Sir Edwmd, was Sheriff in 1421, and as such a witness to the Earl
of Worcester's Cardiff Charter. He was seneschal of Havod-y-Porth, Margam 1425, and Kenfig 1460, and
ancestor of the Stradlings of Wilts. He married the Dauntsey heiress, and was of Winterbourne-Dauntsey,
