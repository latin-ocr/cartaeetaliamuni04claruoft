Endorsed—‘ Inquisitio post mortem Laurenoii Berkerolles 13 Henrioi 4ti. 1411?
(1) adjacentibus, MS. (2) Queque de aliis, one 01 the MSS.

There are two copies of this document in possession of the Royal Institution 01 South Wales, at
Swansea, to which the Francis Charters, noted in this work as Gr. G. F. now belong.

This inquisition throws light upon the descent 01 several important mauors in the Lordship 01
Glamorgan, and disentangles in great part what would otherwise have been an almost hopeless genea-
logical confusion.

Sir Payn Turberville, 01 00119, was father 01 (1.) Sir Gilbert Turberville, who died s.p. ; (11.) Sir
Richard, who died, s.p.l.; (ΙΠ.) Wenllian, married Sir Roger Berkerolles3 (IV.) Margaret, married Sir
Richard Stackpole; (V). Agnes, married Sir John de la Bere3 (VI.) Sarah, married William Gamage.
The estate was settled upon the sisters and the heirs male 01 their bodies in succession. These were ι-ἢ

1. Sir Laurence Berkerolles‚ who died 1411, s.p. Π. Wenllian Berkerolles‚ married Sir Edward
Stradling, 01 St. Donats, aud had Sir william, father 01 Edward Stradling, age 22 in 1411, the elder heir.
ΙΙΙ. Sarah Berkerolles, married — Stradling, and had John Stradling, age 60 in 1411.

1. Richard Stackpole, father 01 1631161 Stackpole, who probably died before the question 01 heirship
arose. Π. J oan Stackpole‚ age 40 in 1411, married Richard Vernon, and had Sir Richard Vernon.

1. John de la Bere, father 01 Thomas de 13 Bere, age 9 in 1411. 11. Elizabeth de la Bere, married Sir
John St. John, and had Sir John St John, 01 Fonmon. 111. Susan de la Bere, married Sir Elias Bassett,
of Beaupre, and had issue.

Ι. william Gamage, father of Gilbert, father 01 Wflliam Gamage, age 30 in 1411.

Eventually, after various 1116 1111616616, and much legal dispute, Coyty, Newcastle, N ewland and 111311-
harry, the old Turberville estate, passed to the descendants 01 Sarah Turberville by William Gamage.
The final heiress, Barbara Gamage, married Sir Robert Sydney, Earl 01 Leicester. On the failure 01 1116
111316 line of the Sydneys, the estates were divided and solfl.

The Berkerolles estates descended naturally in a different channel. The name first appears near
Bassaleg in Monmouthshire, in a declaration by Bishop Uchtred of Llandaffi tested at Bassaleg, and con-
firmed in 1146 by the whole synod 01 Llandaff. In the Oartulary 01 St. Peter 01 Gloucester mention is
made 01 1116 land of william de Berkerola (1155), probably one of Fitz Hamon's followers. In 1165
Roger de BerkeroP held one see in Gloucestershire, under William, Earl 01 Gloucester (Liber Niyer, 1163).
But this may include Monmouth and part 01 Glamorgan. Sir Roget, Cecilia his wife, and William and
Robert their 60116, joined in confirming Sir William's gift to Glastonbury. Roger's name is preserved in
the ruins 01 1116 036116 01 Rogerston, on the Ebbw River. Another william attests 3 char-ter by Countess
Isabel 01 Gloucester, 1213-1216 (N. Mon. IV. 634). A William also appears in a ‘Quod damnum ’⁵ inqui-
sition, as to the Abbot and Convent 01 Clyve, 1291-2.

11 was probably about this time that they settled in Glamorgan. The Ner-bers in 1165 held four 1666
under the Earl 01 Gloucester, apparently in St. Tathan’s, which included Orchard, and one 01 111066 1666 in
1315 was held by William Berkeroles, who in 1320 held δὲ 1666 111 St. Tathan's which included East Orchard,
where the family settled. Sir Roger, who died 11th November, 1351, granted East Orchard to his eldest
son, Gilbert. Gilbert died before 1116 father, and was followed by Sir Laurence, his brother, aged 14 in
1352, who held the δὲ sees, and died childless, seized of East Orchard. The next owner, and the last 01 1116
family upon record, was Sir Laurence, whose inquisition is given above, and who held the manors 01
Orchard and Merthyr-mawr under Cardiff 3 Lanfey under the Duohy 01 1133636161, Coyty Castle and
Lordship, Newcastle, Newland, and Llanharry manors and advowsons, and the manor 01 Basalleg.

Some mutilated effigies 01 3 cross-legged Knight and his lady in St. Woolos’ Church are thought to
represent early members 01 1116 family. The later members are buried and have effigies at St. Tathan’s.

The Coyty 11133016 descended as explained above. The Berkerolles mauors, East Orchard‚ Lanfey, and
Merthyr-mawr, descended to the Stradlings, and on the extinction ot' that family, were sold.
