has been seen, were sistere, daughters of John Giles the elder, of Le Moreshede near Cardiff, from whom
the property descended. As the ladies were co-heiresses, it is probable that John Giles the younger, whose
existence is implied, was dead. It was evidently upon the acquisition of these properties in Nash that
Howel Carne based an ultimately successful scheme of securing the manor. There is no mention in the
Button pedigree of a match with eriles, else it seems that Wenllian Button was a probable third co-heiress.

The pedigree of Giles does not appear to have been preserved. William Ivel or J uel, a juror in the
county inquisition of 1262, is probably their ancestor; and John J ule appears in the Spencer Survey of
1320 as one of the holders in the great Nerber fee. J uleston is there mentioned between West and East
Orchard, and is the present parish of Gileston. In the [ηρ. p. m. (ii, 163), 24 Edward HL, 1350, Thomas Ivel
is seized of Ieoleston, co. Gloucester, evidently Ivelston in Glamorgan, which county at this time is some-
times included in Gloucester. Indeed, in the very next entry, John de Nerberd of Castleton is placed in
that county. The actual entry is more full, and sets forth that ‘ Thomas Ivel tenuit die quo obiit de herede
Hugonis le Despenser manerium de J eoliston cum advocatione ecclesie ejusdem per servicium unius feodi
militis et valet per annum 24 12s. 2d. Et J ohannes filius et heres predicti Thome est de etate 13 annorum.
24 Edward 111. ΑΛ). 1350.’ This is the John Joel of J oelston manor, in South Wales, who appears in
the escheats of 36 Edward [ΙΙ. (I. p. m. ii. 251), and of whom the family of Penarth were probably cadets.

In the reign of Elizabeth a Matthew Giles had lands in Gileston, Llancarvan, Llantrithyd‚ Kenislond,
and Kenisham, and left Ann his widow, who was plaintiff in a suit in Chancery, under her settlement,
against William Giles, who claimed under a deed oi gift from Matthew. There was a Matthew Giles,
gent„ buried at Gileston, Sth Sept, 1618, whose wife was Mary ; and their son, Major Wm. Gsses, died there,
5th June, 1673. He was probably the last, for Winefred, his daughter and heiress, carried Gileston manor
and advowson to her husband, James Allen, gent„ who became of Gileston, and died there, 6th March,
1711. They left two daughters only, of whom the elder Mary, married (1) Richard Carne of Ewenny,
(2) The Rev. John Willis. The Wfflis's ended in a Mary, who married the Rev. John Edwards, and died
in 1809, leaving a daughter who married John J ohnes of Dolecothaw, co. Carmarthen ς whose descendants
still own the manor. Giles bore ..... a cross crossiet, placed saltirewise .....

The name of Giles is also found in the court rolls of the district. In 1628 Ann Giles was of Llancadle,
as in 1630 was William Giles. william Giles occurs also in Penmark in 1672.
