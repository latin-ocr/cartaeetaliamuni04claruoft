The names in this document relate to the eastern part of the county, but not to Cardiff. Howell ap
Thomas ap Howell Button corroborates three generations of the pedigree of Button of WVorlton.
Llewelyn ap Madoc Cady, and William ap David have not been identified. John Graunte, of Llanishen‚
bears a name of which there were two families in Glamorgan, one of Sigginston by Cowbridge, and the
other of Lloyn·y-Grant in Llanedern. The Buttons, also, whose pedigree, amphisbaena like, had two heads,
traced one of them to a Graunt. In the Llanedern pedigree there are two or three John Grants. David
ap Llewelyn ap Ievan ap Grono7 clerk, Morgan ap Ievan ap Jankyn, and William Stradling, come next.
Also there appears Sir William ap Thomas. sheriff of the county. Who he was is uncertain. He was not
of Llanfihangel. Rees Meyrick (p. 50) mentions a Sir William ap Thomas, who may have been the man.
It is not probable that the founder of the Herbert family would have filled the office of Sheriff even under
a Beauchamp. Wygrym, who countersigns, was probably the clerk of the Oardiff Chaucery, as ⁶ Plumer,’
who countersigns an indenture of 1439, may also have been.
