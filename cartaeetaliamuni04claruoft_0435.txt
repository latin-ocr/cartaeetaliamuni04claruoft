THOMAS THOMAS. J oHN CARNE. ΗΕΝ. ΒΑεεΕΤΤῖ

Richard Beauchamp was the head of that branch of the great family of the name that descended from
Walter of Elmley Oastle temp. Henry L, and, upon the extinction of the lines of Bedford and Eaton,
became chief of the whole race, of which he was the most powerful and the most distinguished member.

Richard was g.-g.-g -grandson of William Beauchamp, who married Isabel, sister and heiress of William
Mauduit, Earl of Warwick, His father, Earl Thomas, died 2 Henry IV.‚ 1401. Richard was born at
Salwarp, in Worcestershire, 28th J anuary, 5 Richard IL, and 4 Henry IV. had livery of his inheritance. He
at once took part with the King against Owen Glendwyr, and was presen at the battle of Shrewsbury. He
afterwards visited Palestine‚ travelling thither through France and Italy in great state, and returning
through Muscovy and North Germany He then became Captain of Calais, and attended the Council of
Oonstance at the head of the English deputation, escorted by 800 horse. He afterwards took a distinguished
part in the wars of Henry V. in France, and aided at the siege of Rouen.

Under King Henry's will he became guardian of the infant Henry VI„ whom he served faithfully for
sixteen years, dying at Rouen 30th April, 17 Henry VL, 1439. He was particularly celebrated for his
personal strength and courage, and for the magnificence of his mode of life. He was a principal in most
of the great jousting matches of his day, and seems to have been unsurpassed as a skilful and courteous
Knight.

The Earl married first, Elizabeth, daughter and heiress of Thomas Lord Berkeley, by whom he left
daughters only. His second wife, married 6th March, 1423, was Iezabel, daughter and heiress of Thomas
Lord le Despenser, Earl of Gloucester, Lord of Glamorgan and Morgan, and widow of Richard Beauchamp,
Earl of Worcester, and of Lord Abergavenny‚ his uncle's son. She died within a few months after her
husband, her will being proved 4th February following. Their son was Henry, Duke of Warwick.

The Earl's usual style was ‘ Oomes de Warrewyk et de Aumarle Signor de Lisle et Capitaine de Rouen,’
but in the Harleian Charter, 53 Η. 17, the legend on his seal is Comes Warwici et Albemarle, Dominus
Despenser. In Glamorgan he retained his main title only, and added to it those acquired by his marriage.
He was created Earl of Aumarle or Albemarle in 1417, for life only.

The arrangement of the quarterings upon the Llantrisant seal is somewhat peculiar. The Earl's
paternal arms are quartered with those of his wife, but the contents of each quarter are impaled, probably
to give greater space, and therefore more boldness to the bearings. Beauchamp, the Earl's own coat,
impales Newburgh, the accepted coat of the Earldom of Warwick, and to de Clare, as the greatest of the
families which have held the Lordship of Glamorgan, is given the preeedence before le Despenser, the
paternal coat of the Countess. The seal of the Harleian Chai-ter, cited above, bears quarterly Beauchamp
and Newburgh, and on a shield of pretence, quarterly, Clare and Despenser. Crest, a swan’s head and
neck. Supporters, a bear and a griffin.

The present Charter confirms and recites four others: That by Richard Earl of Worcester, Countess
Isabel's first husband, dated 24th August, 9 Henry V„ 1421. Π. That by Thomas le Despenser, Lord of
Glamorgan, dm, Countess Isabel’s father, dated 18th February, 20 Richard IL, 1397, before his promotion to
the Earldom of Gloucester. 111. That by Edward le Despenser, Lord of Glamorgan, δια, the father of
Earl Thomas. It is dated 2nd J uly, 32 Edward HL, 1358. IV. That by Hugh le Despenser, Lord of
Glamorgan, δια, uncle to Lord Edward, dated 4th May, 20 Edward HL, 1346. This last is, of course, the
containing Charter. -
