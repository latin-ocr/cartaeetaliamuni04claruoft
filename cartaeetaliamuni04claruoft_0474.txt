1552

The third [MOLXXX.], dated 1448, two days later, is the inspection, reoital, and confirmation of the

same by the Archdeacon and Chapter.
The fourth [MCOLXIX.], dated 1499, is an approval by the Archdeacon and Chapter, of a lease, by

Bishop John Ingleby, of the same to the same, for ninety years, at thirty shinings annually, dated one

da earlier.
yThe fifth [MGGGX V1.]‚ is the grant of the manor in perpetuity‚ at a payment of thirty-one shillings

annually, to the same, by Bishop George Athequa, dated 1521. This Bishop, a foreigner and non-resident,
dates, not as his predecessor, from the Palaoe at Llandaff, but from ‘our Ospice at Ryohemount‚'
no doubt a residence attached to the Court, and probably held by the Bishop as chaplain to Queen

Katherine of Arragon.
Finally [MOOOXV11.]‚ the sixth Char-ter is an inspection, etc.‚ of the preceding grant by the Arch-

deacon and Chapter, dated twenty-seven days later.
As Llandaff, until reoently, had no Dean, the Chapter was presided over by the Archdeacon, who here

appears as confirming the Bishop's lease. Bishop John Wells, whose lease is confirmed, was appointed
9th J uly, 1425, and died 1440. David, Lewis, and Robert Mathew were the three sons of Mathew ap Evan
ap Griffith Gethyn of Llandaff, and the first of that well-known family who used a surname. Sir David,
standard-bearer of England under Edward 1V.‚ has a noble tomb at Llandaff 3 Robert was ancestor of the
house of Castell-y-Mynaoh 3 and Lewis left but the daughter, who married John Raglan of Garnllwydd.
