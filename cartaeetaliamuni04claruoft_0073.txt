William la Zouch, commonly called ‘ of Mortimer,' was a younger son of Robert Mortimer, of Richards
castle. He assumed the sur-name of Zouch with the manor- of Ashby-de-la-Zouch. On the fall of the
younger le Despenser he became custos of the lordship and married his widow Alianor, the elder de Clare

heiress. His children were by a former wife.

The founder of the family of Umfravile in England was Robert de Umf1·anville‚lord of Tours, who
had a grant of Redesdale in 1076, and is said, rather doubtfully, to derive his family name from
Un-franc—ville. Of his three sons the third was of Prudhoe, and the second, Gilbert, became a large iandowner
111 the south-west of England, and he or hie son, being a tenant of the Honour 01· Gloucester joined in
the invasion of Glamorgan, where he obtained 4 sees in Penmark, and there built a castle, and founded or
re-built the parish church. Gilbert de U.‚ Nest, Henry their son, and Sibilla, occur in Charters about
1196-1205. Gilbert witnessed a Tewkesbury deed in 1104, founded an obit there for the sou] of his wife
Nema, temp. Henry Π. Henry accounted for ‚⁴:48 sor a relies, and alienated land in Llancarvan in favour of
Brifin ab Urban. His 7th or 8th descendant left an heiress, who carried Penmark to her husband, Sir
Simon de Fumeaux, who died 36 Edw. ΠΙ. 011 the death of their daughter s.p., Penmark seems to have
reverted to the male heir, ending again in an heiress, Elizabeth‚ who married Sir John Blunt, and inherited
a moiety of the estate. Their child, Elizabeth, seems to have inherited both moieties. She married Sir John
St. John, of Fonmon, whose descendant, the Earl of Bolinbroke, sold the whole to (301. J ones, one of
Cromwell's supportem, ancestor of the present owner of Fonmon. Whence Sir John Blunt came is uncertain,
but he or a near relative married the heiress of Avene, who had Sully.
