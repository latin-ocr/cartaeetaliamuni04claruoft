Penmaffl, or Penmarch-Hovel, is an important maner and parish, containing several sub-mauors, a
handsome church, and the ruins of a considerable castle. It was held by the service of four knights’ sees
by Gilbert dc Umfreville or Umframvflle, who claims to be head of that well known family, who held
lands in Somerset and the West of England, and of whom a branch built Prudhoe castlc, and became
Earls of Augus. Those οἱ Penmark were early settlers under Fitzhamon‚ and held also five-and-a-hali
sees in Devon with the Torrington heiresS. Their heiress, after many descents, carried Penmark to the
St. J ohn’s, whose descendants sold the estate.

The principal sub-maner, Fonmon, was very early St. John property, held by the service of one
knight’s fee, and where they builta late N erman castle, still inhabited. Fonmon was sold by an Earl of
Bolingbroke to Colone] J ones, whose descendants still hold it. See DCCCCLXX.

A second sub-manor, was Odyn’s fec, now called Penmark Place‚ held by the odyn family, of whom
Henry, John and Thomas occur in the charters between 1290 and 1326, when Joan, daughter of Thomas,
carried the estate by marriage to Robert le Soor of St. Fagans. Thence it came to the Bawdrips
[DGGCCLXXIV.], and by them was sold to Sir Thomas Lewis, a cadet„ of Van, whence it descended to
St. John, of Highlight, and finally to Kemeys Tynte, of Cefn Mably, who now holds it.
