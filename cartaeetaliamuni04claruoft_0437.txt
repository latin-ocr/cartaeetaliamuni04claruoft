wiltu. He afterwards took orders, and became Archdeacon of Llandaff and Rector of Merthyr Mawr.
Sir ,1 ohn St. John was probably the great grandson of Sir John St. John and Elizabeth Umfraville.
Watkyn Morton was probably an English burgess of Cardiff with Welsh connexione. J enkyn ap David
ap Llewelyn vachan seems to have been the great grandson of the Llewelyn vachan already mentioned.
Of the Mathews, there were three brothers, David, Robert, and Lewis Mathew, of Llandaff, the first
generation who adopted that surname. Robert was ancestor of the Mathews of Castel-y-Mynach‚ and
David, then knighted, is said to have been standard—bearet to Edward IV„ at least forty years after the
date of this Charter. Howell ap Grono ap Ivor was of Llansannor, which, on his death childless, passed
to Elinor, h’rs'sister, who married Richard ap Howell (Herbert) of Perthir, and had John Gwyn, ancestor
of the Gwyns of Llansannor. Llewelyn ap J evan Madoc seems not nnlikely to be the Llewelyn ap J evan.
Many of the Welsh pedigrees, sixth in descent from Madoc ap Jestyn. He was of Abergorky. Morgan
ap Llewelyn ap J evan was probably seventh in descent from Madoc ap J estyn, and his elder representative.
He was of Radyr, and married Eva, daughter of Evan Gethyn. Catherine, their daughter and coheir‚
seems to have carried Radyr to her husband, Thomas Mathew.

In the containing Charter of 1424, the Sheriff, Sir Oliver St. John, knighted before 1421, is of Fonmon,
and probably brother of the next witness.

Of the places named in these Charters, Llantrisant, guarded by its triple hagiocracy, still remains,
perched high upin a noteh between two still higher summits, much resembling a Greek town in its position,
its white exterior, and in some other particulars within. One fragment of the castle still predominates
over the whole, and the meadow is still pointed out where Edward Π. was captured. The town retains
something of the constitution granted by its ancient Lords, and preserves its one remaining parchment
with religious care. To it, as to its sister borough of Cowbridge, was aceorded a share. with Cardiff, in
the somewhat doubtful advantage of returning a member to Parliament. Formerly the parish was of
vast extent, but by degrees the chapels have become ehurches, and the Vicar of Llantrisant is responsible
fora diminished though not unimportant area. Glyn Rothney, or Rhondda and Miskyn, are two extensive
Lordships granted to the Herberts by the Crown, and still held by Lord Bute. Llwyn-Crwn is the present
name of two houses upon the northern boundary of the borough, and the Manor of Clun remains to its
south-west. Housbote and keybote and the right of pannage in the woods of Miskyn are no longer of
value, the woods having been exhausted by the infant manufactory of iron in the reign of Elizabeth.

The boundaries of the borough are not followed out in the usual way. Only the extreme points at the
four quarters seem to be indicated.

It is remarkable that the Chai-ter of Hugh le Despenser here preserved, and dated 1346, is silent as to
any previous Charter of incorporation. Nevertheless, such there evidently was, as it takes for granted
the existence of Burgesses‚ Burgages, and elected officers of the borough. ‘ Confirmasse’ also supports
this view. Cardiff is in a similar case, its earliest Charter from its Lords being by Hugh de Despenser in
1338. With him, however, concurs his wife, the de Clare heiress.

The privileges either granted or confirmed in 1346 are :—

1. The burgesses, as their ancestors were, and as their successors will be, are free throughout the lord's
dominions in England and Wales x free with their merchandize and chattels from toll, wall-tax, bridge-tax,
pavage, pickage and quay-tax, and from all other customs.

2. Any burgess may will any burgage tenements or rents by himself aequired to whom he shall please.

3. No burgess to be constrained for any purpose to pass beyond the ancient liberties and bounds of the
town as laid down.

4. Burgessess not to be receivers of the lord's taxeS, save those proceeding from the bailiwick of the
town.

5. None shall keep stall or shop or tavern in the town save those paying scot and lot, or members of a
guild within the liberties.
